# blockchain-boot-camp
Final project idea for boot camp


Idea of this project will be to develop dapp that would have functionality to track ownership of the documents on chain. 
User should be able to have function to as owner register certain document on chain with signature and additional context data(TBD what document data to put on chain).
Other user of the platform if they receive document (via email or other chanels) should be able to validate on chain that document is registered and to validate owner (signature) and additional data.

This solution should provide easy exchange of documents between parties involved where parties should have publicly available cryptographyc proof of document owner and additional data. 

For the purpose of this project web based solution will be developed but in general mobile application would be better solution.
